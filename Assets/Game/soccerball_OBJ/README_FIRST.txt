Dirty Soccer Ball***

A highly detailed regulation size 5 soccer ball.  The model was created in 3dsmax 2012, and includes all texture maps for color, bump, and specular channels.  The texture maps are 2048x2048px, and detailed enough to hold up under high resolution, close-up rendering.

The model is available as a native 3dsmax 2012 scene file (.max), and also in several scaled .obj formats, for importing easily into other applications, like Blender and Poser.

You are free to use or modify this object as you see fit, for use in your scenes as a prop, or any other type of scene where you may need a quality soccer ball. This model is free to use for both commercial and non commercial renders. You may not, however, resell this object, or any derivative of it; individually or as part of a package/set.

*** OBJ users, the Poser-specific OBJ version was exported with a scale conversion that should load with the appropriate scaling into most Poser 9 and above. To ensure proper import, BE SURE to DE-select all check box options boxes in the Import Options dialogue. DESELECT the "Centered", "Place on Floor", "Percent of Standard Figure Size", etc. options in the import dialogue box after you select the poser .obj file, and then the object should load with correct scale into the scene.

**** All textures were created by me, but most of the original reference textures originated at CGTextures.com texture resource website.***
